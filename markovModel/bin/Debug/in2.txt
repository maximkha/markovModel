The full moon rises and shines with light,
It's pale gray face lights up the night,
Uncertain moonbeams glimmer and strain,
They dance upon the windswept plain.
Hear the wolf howl, the sound mournful and old,
A sound full of bloodlust, of stories long told,
It weaves through the stars until an echo will mark,
Where it enveloped the moon and faded to dark.
Hear the raven's sorrowful cry,
A song of solitude that sings to the sky,
He shakes off his feathers dusted with snow,
Beady eyes shine, how much does he know?
Hear the wind sigh through grass the color of lime,
It whispers old secrets lost even to time,
Listen to me, my voice filled with regret,
For it harbors truths others would sooner forget.

Swirling sadness spinning sweet,
Sifting soft through simple streets,
Screams of silence scraping stone,
Silver sounds of melting moans.
Carving claws in chaos keep,
Crawling killers quickly creep,
Cracking crystal carnivores,
Crooning free forevermore.
Printed, peaceful, pretty pages,
Parted poems that pass the ages,
People picking senseless swords,
Pointless, pretty, useless words.

Sitting softly, sadly sigh,
Watch as birds of crystal fly,
The sky, a mirror, cracking slow,
And sharpened blades of grass below.
The sun is dripping slowly down,
The golden rays, the moon they drown,
Stars will whisper stories torn,
From writhing shadows secrets born.
Looking to the ocean's foam,
Where china figures wail and roam,
Upon the waves of sapphire shards,
Hands of sand, the sea they guard.
Forests filled with dust and wine,
Deserts filled with boughs and vines,
A world so beautiful with hate,
In which one will always wait.

Melting sand pools in the sky,
While deserts sing a lullaby,
The wind sighs a witches' rune,
Weaving 'neath the mirrored moon.
Shattered skies cry above,
Echo songs of the mourning dove,
A thousand beats of broken wings,
'Till the shards the morning brings.
A vertical horizon stands,
Cradled in their crystal hands,
And shadows dance upon the night,
To the beat of fading light.
And see the creatures whirling high,
Dancing in the storm's great eye,
The nighttime howls a silent scream,
Pulsing in the gypsy's dream.
